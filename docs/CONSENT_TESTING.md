## üîß Testing Tools

### Debug Panel
The debug panel (development only) provides:
- Real-time consent state monitoring
- Quick action buttons for testing
- Purpose-level control toggles
- Storage inspection tools
- Region simulation

Access via the purple bug icon in the bottom-right corner.

### Browser DevTools

#### Console Commands
```javascript
// Check current consent state
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('ak-consent')));

// Listen for consent events
window.addEventListener('consent_updated', console.log);

// Check Google Consent Mode
console.log(window.dataLayer);
```

#### Application Tab
- Check cookies for `ak-consent`
- Check localStorage for `ak-consent`
- Clear storage to simulate first visit

### Network Tab
- Verify analytics requests only fire with consent
- Check for consent-related API calls
- Monitor third-party script loading

## üåê Cross-Browser Testing

Test in all major browsers:
- [ ] Chrome (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Firefox (desktop & mobile)  
- [ ] Safari (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Edge (desktop)

Pay special attention to:
- Cookie persistence differences
- LocalStorage availability
- Focus management variations
- Rendering differences

## üì± Mobile Testing

Mobile-specific checks:

## üîí Security Testing

- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities in user data
- [ ] Consent data is properly escaped
- [ ] Third-party scripts only load with consent
- [ ] Storage writes don't exceed quotas

## ‚ö° Performance Testing

- [ ] Consent system loads without blocking page render
- [ ] Modal opens quickly (<100ms perceived)
- [ ] No memory leaks from event listeners
- [ ] Minimal impact on Lighthouse scores

## üß© Integration Testing

### Analytics Integration
```javascript
// Test that analytics respects consent
ga4.gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
// Should only fire if analytics consent granted
```

### Custom Event Handling
```javascript
// Test custom consent event handling
window.addEventListener('consent_updated', (e) => {
  if (e.detail.purposes.marketing === 'granted') {
    // Should initialize marketing tools
  }
});
```

## üö® Error Scenarios

Test error handling for:

- [ ] Unsupported browser features
- [ ] Very long consent descriptions (UI overflow)

## üìä Compliance Testing

### GDPR Compliance

### Google EU User Consent Policy

- [ ] Consent records maintained with required fields
- [ ] Clear instructions for withdrawing consent

## üîÑ Automated Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash

npm run test -- --testPathPattern=consent

# E2E tests  
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/consent/

# Accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Visual regression tests (if available)
npm run test:visual -- consent
```

## üìã Test Data

### Test Consent Records

Valid consent record format:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bannerVersion": "1.0.0", 
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "language": "en",

  "purposes": {
    "strictly-necessary": "granted",
