- Fixed postMessage target origin across all communication points
- Simplified origin validation with explicit allowlist for cloud and local origins
- Enhanced origin parsing with HTTPS protocol support
- Improved connection state validation in message handling
- Removed dead code and unused message queue processing
- Changed 10 error logs to debug level for non-critical conditions
- Fixed typo in debug message ("ered message" â†’ "Filtered message")
- Added new translation keys for error handling

## Very Short Summary
