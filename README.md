# üêæ AutoKitteh - Web UI

## Overview üåü

[AutoKitteh](https://www.autokitteh.com) is an open-source, developer-first framework aimed at simplifying the automation of distributed systems. It supports various deployment models including on-prem, cloud, and hybrid systems.

This repository contains the web UI for the AutoKitteh backend. The application allows users to create projects from a list of templates or start blank projects. It provides functionality to manage project entities such as code files, connections, triggers, and variables. Users can build and deploy projects on the server, view a list of deployments, and monitor sessions within those deployments. This interface facilitates the process of working with AutoKitteh, making it easier to develop, manage, and deploy automation projects.

Use the following command to run the application with Docker

-   `docker compose -f development.compose.yml up`

## How to Install and Run ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites üìã

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Node.js** (version 16.x or later)
-   **npm** (version 7.x or later)
-   **Git** (for version control and repository management)

### Installation Steps üöÄ

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    `git clone https://github.com/autokitteh/web-platform && cd autokitteh`

2.  **Get AutoKitteh Submodule**: Use git to install the AutoKitteh submodule:

    `git submodule update --init`

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Use npm to install all the required dependencies:

    `npm install`

### Environment Setup üåê

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to the `validateEnv` script for required variables:

`sh cp .env.example .env # Edit .env with your environment-specific settings`

`VITE_HOST_URL`

-   Default: A predefined default host URL mentioned in [getApiBaseUrlFile](https://github.com/autokitteh/web-platform/blob/main/src/utilities/getApiBaseUrl.utils.ts)
-   Description: Defines the backend URL that the application will use as its host. If not set, the application will use a default host URL.
-   Example: VITE_HOST_URL=http://localhost:1234

`VITE_AUTH_ENABLED`

-   Default: false
-   Description: Determines whether the application should restrict access to logged-in users or users with a valid JWT token. Set to true to enable authentication protection.
-   Example: VITE_AUTH_ENABLED=false

`VITE_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID`

-   Default: None
-   Description: Required for OAuth authentication using Descope. If you want to allow users to connect to the app using OAuth, you need to provide your Descope project ID here.
-   Example: VITE_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=your_descope_project_id

`TESTS_JWT_AUTH_TOKEN`

-   Default: None
-   Description: Used for running E2E tests when authentication is enabled on the backend. This JWT token allows the test runner to authenticate and access the application during testing.
-   Example: TESTS_JWT_AUTH_TOKEN=your_jwt_auth_token_for_e2e_tests

**Note:** These environment variables are optional. The application will use default values or fall back to certain behaviors if these variables are not set. However, setting them allows for greater customization and functionality, especially in different deployment environments or when running tests.
